You are a senior front-end developer and build engineer. I will provide you an API specification for the "SmartLife" backend (endpoints, request bodies and response schemas). Your task is to implement a complete, production-ready **Vue 3 + Vite** front-end application that fully works with this API and to produce a ZIP archive of the finished project that runs locally with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

IMPORTANT: use the placeholder `{API_BASE_URL}` for the API base URL (the integrator will replace it with the real base URL). All requests must be sent to `{API_BASE_URL}` + the endpoint paths below. Implement robust error handling and token-based auth flow using `localStorage` for the JWT token.

### Project requirements
- Tech stack: **Vue 3 (Composition API)**, **Vite**, **TailwindCSS**.
- Use **Axios** for HTTP requests. Create a centralized `api` service that sets `Authorization: Bearer <token>` when logged in.
- Organize code: `src/components`, `src/views`, `src/services`, `src/router`, `src/store` (pinia or simple composables).
- Provide responsive, clean UI. Use Tailwind utility classes.
- Provide user authentication (Register, Login, Get current user).
- Implement CRUD flows for tasks and conspectus and folder management per API.
- Include forms with validation and UX states: loading, success, error.
- Provide page routing: Login, Register, Dashboard, Tasks, Task Details/Edit, Conspectus (folders list + conspectus list + create/move), Profile (update user), NotFound.
- Include a small dashboard view with task stats (using `/api/tasks/stats`) and recent items.
- Implement client-side filtering of tasks (by `status` and `priority`) using the API filter endpoints.
- Include sample unit or integration test file(s) for at least one component (optional but preferred).

### Build & deliverable requirements
- Provide full project file tree: `package.json`, `vite.config.js`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `index.html`, all `src/` files.
- Provide a runnable `README.md` with exact setup steps:
  1. `npm install`
  2. set `VITE_API_BASE_URL={API_BASE_URL}` in `.env`
  3. `npm run dev`
- Assemble and return a **ZIP** archive named `smartlife-vue-frontend.zip` containing the entire project root (no nested extra folders).
- The project must start with `npm run dev` without compilation/runtime errors (apart from API responses when backend not available).
- Provide a single CLI command in README to create the ZIP (or simply deliver the ZIP). If you cannot actually create the binary ZIP, provide exact script and file list and the full content of each file so I can reproduce.

### Authentication endpoints (use these)
- POST `/auth/register`
  Request body example:
  ```json
  {
    "firstName":"string",
    "lastName":"string",
    "username":"string",
    "email":"string",
    "password":"string"
  }
Response: string (assume token or message)
POST /auth/login
Request body example:
{
  "username":"string",
  "password":"string"
}
Response: string (assume JWT token). After login store token in localStorage and attach to subsequent requests.
GET /auth/me
Returns current user info.
Tasks endpoints (implement list, create, update, delete, detail, stats, filter)
GET /api/tasks -> list
POST /api/tasks
Body example:
{
  "title":"string",
  "description":"string",
  "date":"2025-10-15",
  "status":"NOT_STARTED",
  "priority":"EXTREME",
  "imageUrl":"string"
}
PUT /api/tasks/update/{taskId} -> update (body same as POST)
GET /api/tasks/{taskId} -> detail
DELETE /api/tasks/delete/{taskId} -> delete
GET /api/tasks/stats -> stats for dashboard (returns totals/percents)
GET /api/tasks/filter/status?status=NOT_STARTED|IN_PROGRESS|COMPLETED
GET /api/tasks/filter/priority?priority=EXTREME|MODERATE|LOW
GET /api/tasks/hello (optional sample)
Conspectus & Folder endpoints (notes)
GET /conspectus/folders -> list folders with conspectusList
POST /conspectus/folder/create -> create folder (string body with folder name)
POST /conspectus/create
Body:
{
  "title":"string",
  "content":"string",
  "folderId":0
}
GET /conspectus/all -> list all conspectus
GET /conspectus/all/{folderId} -> list conspectus by folder
PUT /conspectus/move/{conspectusId}/to/{folderId} -> move conspectus to another folder
User endpoints (profile)
PUT /api/users/update (send user DTO as query/object per API)
PUT /api/users/change-password?newPassword=...
Data models / schemas (use to type components / forms)
TaskDto: { id, title, date, status, priority, description, imageUrl, createdAt }
TaskRequest: { title, description, date, status, priority, imageUrl }
FolderDto: { id, folderName, conspectusList: [ConspectusDto] }
ConspectusDto: { id, title, content, createdAt }
UserDto / UserUpdateDto: { firstName, lastName, username, email, avatarUrl }
TaskStatsDto: { total, completed, inProgress, notStarted, completedPercent, inProgressPercent, notStartedPercent }
UI & UX specifics
Use component-based design: TaskList, TaskCard, TaskFormModal, ConspectusFolderList, ConspectusEditor, MoveConspectusModal, ProfileForm.
Show spinner/loading skeleton while fetching.
Show toast/snackbar on success and errors.
Validate forms client-side (title required, date valid, etc.) and show inline error messages.
For imageUrl allow preview when present.
For moving conspectus show modal with folder selection fetched from /conspectus/folders.
Include a global error boundary or global error handler.
Developer ergonomics
Use environment variable VITE_API_BASE_URL for the base URL.
Provide axios instance file src/services/api.js (or .ts) with interceptors:
Request interceptor to attach token from localStorage.
Response interceptor to handle 401: clear token and redirect to /login.
Provide src/router/index.js with guarded routes (redirect to login when not authenticated).
Provide README.md with API base configuration and example .env.
Deliverable format (strict)
First deliver the complete source files (each file's exact content).
Then provide a ZIP archive smartlife-vue-frontend.zip containing the complete project root.
If you cannot actually produce a binary ZIP, output a shell script build-zip.sh that, when run in a folder containing the listed files, will create the ZIP. In that case also output the exact content of every file so I can recreate them locally.
Validation tests you must run locally and report:
npm run dev starts without compile errors.
Basic manual test flows run: register -> login -> fetch tasks -> create task -> edit task -> delete task -> fetch stats -> create folder -> create conspectus -> move conspectus.
If any endpoint returns unexpected data format, handle gracefully and log the error.
Final instruction
Return only:
the full project source (all files and folders), and
the ZIP archive (or the ZIP creation script + all files contents).
Do not ask for additional information. Assume {API_BASE_URL} will be replaced by the integrator. The front-end must be complete and runnable. If anything is ambiguous in the API responses, make reasonable assumptions and clearly annotate them in README.md.
